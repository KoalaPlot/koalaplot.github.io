Koala Plot is an open source [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) 
based charting and plotting library allowing you to build great looking interactive charts for Android,
desktop, iOS, and web using a single API and code base.

Most elements of a plot are Composables and can therefore be easily customized. This includes things like colors, fonts,
borders, shapes, user interaction, etc.

Try out the [web version of the samples](https://koalaplot.github.io/koalaplot-samples/wasmJs/productionExecutable/index.html) for a quick look at
the possibilities when using Koala Plot. Note that this uses
the [alpha Kotlin wasm Compose web-canvas](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/wasm-overview.html) capability, and you'll
need a browser supporting the [wasm garbage collection feature](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc). For more information
see [https://kotl.in/wasm_help](https://kotl.in/wasm_help).

This project is in a pre-release experimental/alpha state. We encourage you to give it a try, make suggestions for
improvement, and even [contribute](https://github.com/KoalaPlot/koalaplot-core/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)! It is expected
that the API surface and functionality will change as we gain experience using the library in applications.
